# Authentication

All endpoints require the `X-API-Key` header with a valid API key.

## Header Format

```
X-API-Key: your-api-key-here
```

## How to Use Authentication

To access the API, you need to provide a valid API key in every request through the `X-API-Key` header. Make sure you have a registered API key before making requests. If the API key is invalid or missing, the request will be rejected with an appropriate error message.

## Example Request with Authentication

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: example-api-key-here" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/surahs
```
